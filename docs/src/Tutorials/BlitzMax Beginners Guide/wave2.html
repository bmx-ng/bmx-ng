<tr><td class="idx2" colspan="2">I wrote this guide for people new to BlitzMax and perhaps even programming, especially recommended to those who want to take a first step in OOP in BMax. This Introduction should work if you are converting to BlitzMax from any other programming language, including Blitz3D/Plus. It's not written as a BlitzBasic<b> &rarr; </b>BlitzMax tutorial. My aim is to give anyone the opportunity to get a good start in learning the fantastic BlitzMax. If you are converting from Blitz3D/Plus you will get a shock, because there is a lot of new stuff. Ways have changed but I promise you, it's for the better. When you have taken the first steps and learned your way around there is no other place like BlitzMax ; )<br> 
A good way to learn is to do. Read my examples but try to write them yourself. It gives good coding practice. If you want to use any code within this guide for anything, please do so, the code is public.</td></tr>
