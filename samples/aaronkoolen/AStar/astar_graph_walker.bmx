' Possible ways to calculate distance. It's good to specify the edge costs between nodes
' relative to your distance calculations because as they are related. For instance, if you calculate edge costs
' using simple Euclidean distance, so that two adjacent blocks would be 1 away or 1.4 (if diagonal)
' multiplied by some small "difficulty factor", say 1 for normal roads, or 2 for water
' Then distanceEuclidean is a good estimator of distance and distancePseudoEuclidean
' tends to override the edgecosts and the pathfinder sort of busts through them.
